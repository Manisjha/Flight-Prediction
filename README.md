# Flight-Prediction
A hands-on data science project focused on flight fare prediction using EDA and feature engineering. Built with Python, it includes data cleaning, time-based transformations, categorical encoding, and feature extraction. Inspired by Krish Naikâ€™s live session, the project prepares the dataset for machine learning workflows.
